### FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

Financial statements tell us what we need to know about a business without stepping our foot inti it.

| Income   |
| -------- |
| Expenses |

| Assets | Liabilities |
| ------ | ----------- |

Cashflow = Income = Expenses
Equity = Assets - Liabilities

Financial statement of a company as a reflection of the government policy
The 2 type of policy that affect a company

1. Fiscal policy ( set by Congress / House of Representatives) :Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions,
2. Monetary policy ( set by Feds / CBN): Monetary policy is a set of tools used by a nation's central bank to control the overall money supply and promote economic growth and employ strategies such as revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements).

#### Fiscal Policy

Taxes/Spending can create a deficit or surplus.
If deficit, Congress /House of rep is forced to borrow increasing debt

| Taxes (Income)                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Debt servicing, subsidized health care, education sector, Security Personnel (Police, Military , Navy etc) (Expenses) |

| GDP (amount of goods/services produced by a country in a given year)Assets | Debt owed by the Government |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |

If there is a decline in GDP, recession sets in
Cashflow = Taxes collected - Government Expenses
Equity = GDP - Liabilities
If the tax generated is greater than govt spending , that is a positive ( surplus), if lower, then that is a deficit .
If the govt has a lot of money in treasury (a place where the funds of the government,are deposited, kept, and disbursed) , it doesn't worry about deficit.

Looking at a country's financial strength, you will think twice before allowing it to purchase bonds
You consider the Debt/GDP ratio

#### Monetary Policy

1. The determine if treasury bonds will be purchased , Treasury bonds are fixed-income securities issued with the full faith and credit of the federal government, meaning the government must find a way to repay the debt.
2. Gets to decide the interest rates ( increase/decrease)

By lowering the interest rate , it incentivizes borrowing , which in turns boosts the GDP, as people will make more purchases or build industries with money.

### COOPERATE STATEMENTS

First step to bankruptcy is insolvency , when the income is less than the expenses
Valuation

- How we determine value changes with the Earning/Growth rate

#### Price to Earning ratios

Earning : what the company generates
Price : what investors are willing to pay based on how much the company earns

Basics
üßÅ Company A makes cupcakes and earns $5000 weekly ( note this is earnings ( revenues- expenses))
Company A needs to grow and decided to raise capital by selling the shares in the company.
Company A wants to sell 1000 shares

$5000 √∑ 1000 = $5 per share (Earnings per share).
They believe that can continue earning $5000 weekly and more.
The shares may be $10 on the public market, so you are basically paying $10 to get an earning of $5
Price to Earning = price of shares √∑ earnings = $10√∑ $5 is 2
So when you buy a stock , you are paying for earnings too

#### Price Per Earnings and Growth

This is the price to earning per growth rate
Growth rate = ((Final Earnings - Initial Earnings) / Initial Earnings) \* 100

#### Market Capitilization

Think of market capitilization as trying to buy all the shares of a company.
Market capitilization = share price \* no of outstanding shares

- Price per Earnings ( price to pay per earning)
- Price per Book ( price to pay per equity)
- Price per sales ( price to pay per revenue)
